## Introduction

The wildfires incidents are increasing recently. This project can help paint the picture of the state of the earth and how it is important to protect the forest and our environment.

The data is used in this project collected from: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires>

This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This dataset was originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records are acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations.

Due to a large dataset, we chose a smaller dataset which included fire reports from 2012-2015.

## Summary Information

The data reveals that the state had the most wildfire cases during 2012-2015 was __`r summary_info$state_fire_count_max$state`__ with __`r summary_info$state_fire_count_max$number_of_fires`__ wildfires.

The state had the least wildfire cases during 2012-2015 was __`r summary_info$state_fire_count_min$state`__ with __`r summary_info$state_fire_count_min$number_of_fires`__ wildfires.

The biggest wildfire size during 2012-2015 was __`r summary_info$max_fire_size$FIRE_NAME`__, and it happened at __`r summary_info$max_fire_size$STATE`__, in __`r summary_info$max_fire_size$FIRE_YEAR`__ with the size __`r summary_info$max_fire_size$FIRE_SIZE`__ arces, and it was classified as class __`r summary_info$max_fire_size$FIRE_SIZE_CLASS`__.

There are 7 wildfire size classes. A is the smallest size and G is the biggest size.

The most wildfire size class happened during 2012-2015 was __`r summary_info$fire_size_class_max$fire_size_class`__, and it happened __`r summary_info$fire_size_class_max$total_number`__ times.

The least wildfire size class happened during 2012-2015 was __`r summary_info$fire_size_class_min$fire_size_class`__, and it happened __`r summary_info$fire_size_class_min$total_number`__ times.

## Table

### Top 10 biggest fire size during 2012-2015

This table shows the biggest size of wildfires so we can see the damaged that those widlfires caused. There were 5/10 cases happened in 2012 and 3 cases happened in Oregon. 

```{r top_10_biggest_fire_size, echo=FALSE}
# Show the top 10 table (specifying the column names to display)
kable(top_10_biggest_fire_size, col.names = c("FIRE NAME", "STATE", "YEAR", "ACRES", "CLASS"))
```

## Charts

### 1 - Line chart for Number of wildfires in 2012-2015

This line chart shows the relationship between number of fires in Texas, California, Oregon and Washington during 2012-2015.

From this chart, the number of wildfires in California and Texas were higher than in Oregon and Washington.

```{r tx_ca_or_wa, echo=FALSE}
tx_ca_or_wa %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=year, y=number_of_fires, group=state, color=state)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Number of fires among states in 2012-2015") +
  ylab("Number of fire")

```

### 2 - Treemap for wildfires size classes

This treemap shows the relationship among wildfire size classes based on the number of fires happened during 2012-2015. There are 7 wildfire size classes from A to G, with A is the smallest size class and G is the biggest size class.

From this treemap, B size class was the most wildfires while the G size class had the least number of wildfires.

```{r fire_size_class_count, echo=FALSE}
treemap(fire_size_class_count,
        index="fire_size_class",
        vSize="total_number",
        type="index",
        title="Wildfire size class",
        inflate.labels=T
)
```

### 3 - Horizontal barplot for Causes of wildfires during 2012-2015

This horizontal barplot shows the relationship among the causes of wildfires during 2012-2015. From this barplot, debris burning was the cause of the most number of wildfires.

```{r cause_fire_count, echo=FALSE}
cause_fire_count %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=cause, y=number_of_fires)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="#f68060", alpha=.6, width=.4) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Causes of wildfires during 2012-2015") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of wildfires") +
  theme_bw()
