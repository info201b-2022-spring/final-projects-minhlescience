## Finding Data

### 1 - Data set 1:

_**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**_

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

_**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**_

This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This dataset was originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records are acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations.

_**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**_

1.88 million rows

_**How many features (columns) are in the data?**_

130 columns

_**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**_

- The number of wildfires each year in the US and in each state, and how that number progresses over the year.
- Which state has the maximum number of wildfires each year, and how that number progresses over the years.
- Which states appear most frequently in the result of the previous question, which state appears the second most frequently, etc.

_**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**_

Total Wildland Fires and Acres (1983-2020). Prior to 1983, the federal wildland fire agencies did not track official wildfire data using current reporting processes. As a result, there is no official data prior to 1983.

_**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**_

37 rows
	
_**How many features (columns) are in the data?**_

9 columns

_**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**_

- Total number of fires in one year
- Cost of fire suppression.
